## **Overview :**

What is Customer churn? This is essentially the rate at which customers leave a business against the total customers that are actively in business. This is also known as churn rate or customer attrition.
Understanding the factors contributing to churn and implementing strategies to mitigate it can significantly impact a company's bottom line.
